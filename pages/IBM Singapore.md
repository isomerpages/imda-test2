We worked with IBM to set up a 5G showcase at PIXEL to inspire startups and companies on the possibilities of 5G to supercharge AI and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) applications. Tapping on PIXEL’s 5G testbed and AR/VR lab, IBM’s 5G Industry 4.0 team is working with PIXEL’s ARVR incubatees to experiment and develop solutions.
