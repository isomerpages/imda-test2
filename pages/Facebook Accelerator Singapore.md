![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/facebooklogo.png)

We partnered Meta and have run two seasons of the Facebook Accelerator programme from February 2019 to September 2020. Over six months, we incubate and support innovative data-driven startups in developing data innovation models for Asia and the rest of the world, Meta offered mentorship, training and support in using data in live environments. 

PIXEL provided the co-working space and access to creative design consultants for startups to collaborate, build and access key markets. The Facebook Accelerator programme is Metaâ€™s second data innovation startup programme globally, after France, and the first in Asia.
