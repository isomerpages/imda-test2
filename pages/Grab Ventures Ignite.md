We partnered Grab to curate a cross-border immersion pilot programme for Singapore start-ups to venture into the Vietnam market. The programme provides access to world-class expert workshops, mentorship from senior leaders, and immersion trips to regional Grab markets. PIXEL co-organised the Singapore leg of the programme, including workshops on customer-centric innovation and facilities support, with peer learning and networking opportunities for Singapore start-ups to accelerate expansion into Vietnam market.
