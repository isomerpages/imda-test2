Check out our [e-book](https://deploy-preview-27--imda-pixel-prod.netlify.app/files/The_SME_Guide_to_DT_UIUX_DS-(FA).pdf) to learn how your company can benefit from design thinking.

You might have heard about Design Thinking and how it can transform businesses and organisations. But how can it help you in your innovation journey?

Design thinking is anchored on people, on a sweet spot between user desirability, technical feasibility and business viability. It is increasingly used by leading companies as an iterative approach to problem solving, to make their digital transformation more customer-centric. Design Thinking embraces the philosophy of empathy – starting with the customer and working backwards – to develop great digital products, solutions and experiences. It can help sharpen your brand positioning, pivot into adjacent markets and de-risk innovation by understanding your users and accelerating the development process.

We offer leading design thinking consultants, physically at PIXEL or virtually, who support via:

(1) Workshops to help your company learn and apply design thinking in digital transformation and innovation projects. Check out our schedule of Design Thinking workshops [here](/Events).

(2) 1-to-1 Consultation Sessions and Project-based coaching with an expert to have a practical and experiential understanding of Design Thinking principles, and help you develop customer-centric digital products and services.

(3) Tapping on PIXEL’s mentors who can coach and facilitate your innovation projects using a design thinking approach. Check out the list of experts and apply to be mentored [here](/Community/Mentors).
